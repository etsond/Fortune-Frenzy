# Fortune Frenzy
A Python script that simulates a slot machine game. The user can input a bet amount and spin the reels to see if they win any coins. The slot machine has three reels with four symbols each: cherry, lemon, orange, and plum. The payout amounts for each symbol combination are displayed in the game.

## Installation

## Usage
Once you are in the slot-machine directory, you can run the script by executing the main.py file in your terminal:

```
The script will prompt you to enter a bet amount. Once you have entered a valid bet amount, you can spin the reels by pressing enter. The slot machine will display the results of the spin and update your coin balance.
